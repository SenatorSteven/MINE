MINE Is Not Entertaining

![MINE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SenatorSteven/MINE/refs/heads/master/screenshots/sample.png)

## What's a MINE?
Ever thought about playing a game? How about a classic minesweeper? Well now you can play it on your terminal! (ASCII only)

## Features
- Eye strain
- Fun use of your time

## Installation
1. Download
2. Unzip
3. Go to the MINE-main directory
4. Allow "compile.sh" to execute as program
5. Execute "compile.sh", preferably via terminal
6. Done

## Terminal help menu
#### $ mine
<pre>
mine: usage: mine [width] [height] [mines]
</pre>

## Trivia
"MINE" stands for "MINE Is Not Entertaining" because it's a fun project first but a game second. It's
fully functional but you're gonna ruin your eyes completing an expert-tier run.
